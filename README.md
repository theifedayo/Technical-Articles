[DevSecOps in Practice: Integrating Security in the Development Lifecycle](https://www.civo.com/learn/devsecops-monitoring) - `DevSecOps` integrates security practices into the DevOps workflow, shifting `security` left and making it an integral part of the entire software delivery pipeline. This proactive integration ensures security measures are applied at every stage, from code development to testing, deployment, and operations. DevSecOps monitoring continuously assesses application and infrastructure security through data collection, analysis, and interpretation, enabling timely vulnerability identification, threat detection, and incident response.
Throughout this tutorial, I was able to take readers through DevSecOps monitoring while leveraging `Civo's` capabilities for enhanced application security.

[Understanding ACID in Database Engineering](https://theifedayo.medium.com/understanding-acid-in-database-engineering-5abf9259cdc5) - In software engineering, ensuring data consistency and reliability is paramount. One foundational concept that helps achieve this is ACID, which stands for `Atomicity`, `Consistency`, `Isolation`, and `Durability`. ACID properties provide a set of guarantees that define how database transactions should behave to maintain data integrity. Learn about each ACID property, with its significance explained, and practical code examples using a popular relational database management system, `PostgreSQL`.

[Identifying Vulnerabilities in Running Applications Using DAST](https://semaphoreci.com/blog/dast-tools) - DAST tools are vital in the `DevSecOps pipeline` due to the rapid release of software in today's fast-paced development environment. Incorporating security testing into the development process is essential to promptly detecting and addressing flaws. The immediate feedback provided by `DAST tools` plays a critical role in ensuring the `application's security` posture.

[Optimizing Golang Applications for Kubernetes: Best Practices for Reducing Server Load](https://earthly.dev/blog/optimize-golang-for-kubernetes/) - Optimizing `server load` is crucial for ensuring `efficient performance and scalability` of Golang applications running on Kubernetes. As organizations increasingly adopt containerization and Kubernetes for deploying and managing their applications, it becomes imperative to implement best practices for reducing server load to achieve optimal resource utilization, cost-efficiency, and an improved user experience.
